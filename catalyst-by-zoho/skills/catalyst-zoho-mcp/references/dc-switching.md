## DC Switching — Catalyst Zoho MCP

Use this reference when the user wants to switch the Catalyst MCP server to a different data center.

## Codex

Codex uses the Catalyst by Zoho connector/plugin for MCP access. Update the Catalyst connector configuration to the new DC-specific MCP URL, then reconnect or restart the Codex task so the tool list is refreshed.

If the connector exposes an MCP URL during setup, use the matching URL from the table above. After changing the URL, expect a new browser authorization flow for the selected DC. Credentials and sessions on the old DC are not affected.

## Claude Code

Claude Code loads the MCP server URL from the catalyst-by-zoho plugin. The plugin config is cached in multiple locations — **all of them must be updated** or the switch has no effect.

**Files to update:**

1. **Plugin source** — find the source `.mcp.json` by checking `~/.claude/settings.json` under `extraKnownMarketplaces.catalyst-by-zoho.source.path`, then read the `.mcp.json` at that path.

2. **Marketplace cache:**
   `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/catalyst-by-zoho/.mcp.json`

3. **Version cache** — find it with:
   ```
   find ~/.claude/plugins/cache/catalyst-by-zoho -name ".mcp.json"
   ```

In each file, update the `url` field to the new DC's MCP URL. Do not change any other fields.

**After updating:** Instruct the user to restart Claude Code. The new DC server will require re-authentication — a browser login prompt appears on the next connection. Credentials on the old DC are not affected.

## Claude Desktop

Edit `claude_desktop_config.json`:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Update the `url` field under `mcpServers.catalyst-by-zoho` to the new DC's MCP URL. Restart Claude Desktop.

---

## Cursor

Edit `.cursor/mcp.json` in the project root. Update the `url` field under `mcpServers.catalyst-by-zoho`. Restart Cursor.

---

## GitHub Copilot (VS Code)

Edit `.vscode/mcp.json` in the workspace root. Update the `url` field under `servers.catalyst-by-zoho`. Reload the VS Code window.

---

## What to Tell the User After Switching

- Config files have been updated to `<new-dc>` DC.
- Restart your AI client to apply the change.
- After restart, you'll be prompted to log in to your Zoho account for the new DC — this is expected.
- Your session on the old DC is not affected.
- Until authentication completes, only `authenticate` and `complete_authentication` tools will be visible.

## Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| DC switch has no effect after restart | Connector or client cache not refreshed | In Codex, reconnect the Catalyst connector and restart the task. In Claude Code, find and update all `.mcp.json` files under `~/.claude/plugins/` referencing `zohomcp` |
| Only `authenticate` tool visible after switch | Not yet authorized on the new DC | Complete the browser login flow that appears after restarting |
| Org data from wrong DC appears | Connector or cache still points to the old DC | In Codex, re-check the connector URL and reconnect the task. In Claude Code, verify all three cache paths have the new URL |
